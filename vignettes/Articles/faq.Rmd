# Quick macs2 installation (MAC/Linux)
Macs2 is needed for calling peaks in ArchR as its the gold standard universally used. I have not been able to think of a way for windows users to get this installed at this time (would love help with this). Install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/), recommended Python3 as Python2 support is being discontinued. Then use terminal to pip install macs2.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#python3 in terminal
pip3 install --user numpy
pip3 install --user macs2

#python2 in terminal
pip install --user numpy
pip install --user macs2
```
