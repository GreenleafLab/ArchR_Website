ArchR is a full-featured software suite for the analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. It is designed to handle hundreds of thousands of single cells without large memory or computational requirements, keeping pace with the experimental scale that is achievable with commercial platforms such as the 10x Genomics Chromium system.

This website is a complete user's guide to ArchR. We explain how to use ArchR by walking through examples of every analysis we could think of. We also include some more extensive documention on some of the more salient points of scATAC-seq analysis such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. All of the chapters will utilize the same downsampled dataset of hematopoietic cells [Granja* et al. Nature Biotechnology 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31792411). Each chapter will build on the previous so you should ideally start from the beginning and perform all analyses in sequence. __Importantly, these tutorials assume that you are running ArchR locally__.

This walkthrough assumes that you have already successfully installed ArchR and all dependencies. If that is not the case, please [visit the home page](https://www.archrproject.com/index.html) for installation instructions.

There is a search feature that can be enabled using the magnifying glass in the navigation bar above which will help you find whatever it is you are looking for. If you dont find it in this book, or if you think the documentation on this website or in the function annotations is unclear, please [post to our GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/ArchR/discussions) with the __Q&A__ form and we will do our best to clarify. If none of these options help, [send us an email](mailto:archr.devs@gmail.com) and we will do our best to respond in a timely fashion.
