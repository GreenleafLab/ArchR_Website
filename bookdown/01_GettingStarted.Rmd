The following tutorial shows the basics of setting up and interacting with an `ArchRProject` using a gold-standard downsampled dataset of hematopoietic cells [Granja* et al. Nature Biotechnology 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31792411). This tutorial and all of the accompanying vignettes assume that you are running ArchR __locally__. __QQQ__ Once all of these steps work for you, feel free to [set up ArchR to work in a cluster environment](articles/Articles/clusterComputing.html). This tutorial does not explain every detail of every step but rather shows you how to perform the most common analyses. Please see the [Vignettes section](articles/index.html) for more details on each major analytical step and all of the major features of ArchR.

## What is an `ArrowFile` / `ArchRProject`?

The base unit of an analytical projHemeect in ArchR is called an `ArrowFile`. Each `ArrowFile` stores all of the data associated with an individual sample (i.e. metadata, accessible fragments, and data matrices). Here, an "individual sample" would be the most detailed unit of analysis desired (for ex. a single replicate of a particular condition). During creation and as additional analyses are performed, ArchR updates and edits each `ArrowFile` to contain additional layers of information.
It is worth noting that, to ArchR, an `ArrowFile` is actually just a path to an external file stored on disk. More explicitly, an `ArrowFile` is not an R-language object that is stored in memory. Because of this, we use an `ArchRProject` object to associate these `ArrowFiles` together into a single analytical framework that can be rapidly accessed in R. This `ArchRProject` object is small in size and is stored in memory.

Certain actions can be taken directly on `ArrowFiles` while other actions are taken on an `ArchRProject` which in turn updates each associated `ArrowFile`. Because `ArrowFiles` are stored as large HDF5-format files, "get-er" functions in ArchR retrieve data by interacting with the `ArchRProject` while "add-er" functions either (i) add data directly to `ArrowFiles`, (ii) add data directly to an `ArchRProject`, or (iii) add data to `ArrowFiles` by interacting with an `ArchRProject`.

## Getting Set Up

The first thing we do is set up our working directory, load our gene and genome annotations, and set the number of threads we would like to use. Depending on the configuration of your local environment, you may need to modify the number of `threads` used below in `addArchRThreads()`. By default ArchR uses half of the total number of `threads` available but you can adjust this manually as you see fit. If you are using windows, the usable `threads` will automatically be set to 1 because the parallel processing in ArchR is build for Unix-based operating systems.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we provide the gene and genome annotations but you can create your own using the `createGeneAnnotation()` and `createGenomeAnnotation()` functions. See the [Gene and Genome Annotations vignette](articles/Articles/annotations.html) for more information.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Load R Libraries
library(ArchR)

#Create a new folder and set this as the working directory for tutorial analyses
wd <- "ArchR_tutorial"
dir.create(wd, showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
setwd(wd)

#Set Genome Annotations to be used
#Since our tutorial data sets are using scATAC-seq data from hg19 we will set that as the default genome.
addArchRGenome("hg19")

#Set Default Threads for ArchR Functions
#The recommendation is to set it around 1/2 to 3/4 of the total available cores.
addArchRThreads(threads = 6) 
```

## Creating Arrow Files

For this tutorial, we will download a collection of fragment files. Fragment files are one of the base file types of the 10x Genomics analytical platform (and other platforms) and can be easily created from any BAM file. See [the ArchR input file types vignette](articles/Articles/inputFiles.html) for information on making your own fragment files for input to ArchR. Once we have our fragment files, we provide their paths as a character vector to `createArrowFiles()`. During creation, some basic metadata and matrices are added to each `ArrowFile` including a "TileMatrix" containing insertion counts across genome-wide 500-bp bins (see `addTileMatrix()`) and a "GeneScoreMatrix" that is determined based on weighting insertion counts in tiles nearby a gene promoter (see `addGeneScoreMatrix()`). These gene activity scores are described in more depth in the [Gene Activity Score vignette](articles/Articles/geneScores.html).

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Get Tutorial Data ~1.5GB To Download (if downloaded already ArchR will bypass downloading).
inputFiles <- getTutorialData("Hematopoiesis")

#Create Arrow Files (~10-15 minutes) w/ helpful messages displaying progress.
#For each sample, this step will:
# 1. Read accessible fragments.
# 2. Calculate QC Information for each cell (TSS Enrichment, Nucleosome info).
# 3. Filter cells based on QC parameters.
# 4. Create a genome-wide TileMatrix using 500-bp bins.
# 5. Create a GeneScoreMatrix using the custom geneAnnotation related to when we set addArchRGenome.
ArrowFiles <- createArrowFiles(
  inputFiles = inputFiles,
  sampleNames = names(inputFiles),
  filterTSS = 4, #Dont set this too high because you can always increase later
  filterFrags = 1000, 
  addTileMat = TRUE,
  addGeneScoreMat = TRUE
  )

```

## Inferring scATAC-seq Doublets with ArchR
One major source of trouble in single-cell data is the contribution of "doublets" to the analysis. A doublet refers to a single droplet that received a single barcoded bead and more than one nucleus. This causes the reads from more than one cell to appear as a single cell. We remove these computationally and describe this doublet removal process in more depth in the [doublet removal vignette](articles/Articles/doubletRemoval.html).

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Add Infered Doublet Scores to each Arrow File (~2-5 min per sample)
#By default ArchR uses the doublet params as described in the ArchR paper.
#We show some of the main adjustable features below for more information 
#Try ?addDoubletScores to see further documentation on parameters for doublet identification.
doubScores <- addDoubletScores(
	input = ArrowFiles,
	k = 10, #Refers to how many cells near a "pseudo-doublet" to count.
	knnMethod = "UMAP", #Refers to embedding to use for nearest neighbor search with doublet projection.
	LSIMethod = 1
)

```

## Creating An ArchRProject
One major source of trouble in single-cell data is the contribution of "doublets" to the analysis. A doublet refers to a single droplet that received a single barcoded bead and more than one nucleus. This causes the reads from more than one cell to appear as a single cell. We remove these computationally and describe this doublet removal process in more depth in the [doublet removal vignette](articles/Articles/doubletRemoval.html).

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create ArchRProject
#The outputDirectory here describes where all downstream analyses and plots go.
#ArchR will add geneAnnotation and genomeAnnotations related to addArchRGenome("hg19")
#as described above.
projHeme <- ArchRProject(
  ArrowFiles = ArrowFiles, 
  outputDirectory = "HemeTutorial",
  copyArrows = TRUE #This is recommened so that if you modify the ArrowFiles you have an original copy for later usage.
)

#Lets look at our ArchRProject
projHeme

# class: ArchRProject 
# outputDirectory: HemeTutorial 
# samples(6): scATAC_BMMC_R2 scATAC_PBMC_R1 ... scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R2
#   scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R1
# sampleColData names(1): ArrowFiles
# cellColData names(11): DoubletEnrichment DoubletScore ... Sample
#   TSSEnrichment
# numberOfCells(1): 32021
# medianTSS(1): 17.121
# medianFrags(1): 2991
```
We can see from above the specified outputDirectory, sampleNames, sampleColData (column data associated with each sample), cellColData (column data associated with each cell), the number of cells, median TSS enrichment and median number of fragments. Additionally since we already computed doublet enrichment scores
we can see in cellColData a column name "DoubletEnrichment" and "DoubletScore" which are related to the above addition of `addDoubletScores`.


## Manipulating An ArchRProject
Now that we have created an ArchRProject, there ample things that one can do to easily access/manipulate the data associated.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Example 1. The `$` accessor, this allows direct access to cellColData

##A. Access cell names associated with each cell
head(projHeme$cellNames)
#[1] "scATAC_BMMC_R2#CGGACTGGTATGCTAC-1" "scATAC_BMMC_R2#TTATGTCAGTGATTAG-1"
#[3] "scATAC_BMMC_R2#CGGACCACAATTCTCT-1" "scATAC_BMMC_R2#TTGCCCATCGTCTTAT-1"
#[5] "scATAC_BMMC_R2#AAGATAGTCACCGCGA-1" "scATAC_BMMC_R2#GAGGTCCAGCTACGTT-1"

##B. Access sample names associated with each cell
projHeme$Sample
# character-Rle of length 32021 with 6 runs
#   Lengths:                 12009 ...                  3268
#   Values :      "scATAC_BMMC_R2" ... "scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R1"

##C. Access TSS Enrichment Scores for each cell
quantile(projHeme$TSSEnrichment)
#    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% 
# 4.023 14.208 17.121 20.400 50.675 

#Example 2. Subsetting an ArchRProject By Cells

##A. Subsetting like a data.frame numerically

# cellColData names(11): DoubletEnrichment DoubletScore ... Sample
#   TSSEnrichment
# numberOfCells(1): 100
# medianTSS(1): 10.0315
# medianFrags(1): 12194

##B. Subetting like a data.frame with cellNames
projHeme[projHeme$cellNames[1:100], ]
# class: ArchRProject 
# outputDirectory: HemeTutorial 
# samples(6): scATAC_BMMC_R2 scATAC_PBMC_R1 ... scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R2

#   TSSEnrichment
# numberOfCells(1): 100
# medianTSS(1): 10.0315
# medianFrags(1): 12194

##C. Subsetting for 1 sample
idxSample <- BiocGenerics::which(projHeme$Sample %in% "scATAC_BMMC_R2")
cellsSample <- projHeme$cellNames[idxSample]
projHeme[cellsSample, ]
# class: ArchRProject 
# outputDirectory: /scratch/users/jgranja/Analysis/HemeTutorial/HemeTutorial 
# samples(6): scATAC_BMMC_R2 scATAC_PBMC_R1 ... scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R2

#   TSSEnrichment
# numberOfCells(1): 12009
# medianTSS(1): 15.214
# medianFrags(1): 2744

##D. Increasing TSS cutoff
idxPass <- which(projHeme$TSSEnrichment >= 8)
cellsPass <- projHeme$cellNames[idxPass]
projHeme[cellsPass, ]
# class: ArchRProject 
# outputDirectory: /scratch/users/jgranja/Analysis/HemeTutorial/HemeTutorial 
# samples(6): scATAC_BMMC_R2 scATAC_PBMC_R1 ... scATAC_CD34_BMMC_R2

#   TSSEnrichment
# numberOfCells(1): 31581
# medianTSS(1): 17.206

#Example 3. Adding data to an ArchRProject

#Add a column removing replicate info
bioNames <- gsub("_R2|_R1","",projHeme$Sample)
bioNames
