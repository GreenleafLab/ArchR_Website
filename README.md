# ArchR_Website

To build the website:

1. Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the `DESCRIPTION` file and the `.Rd` files created from ArchR when the package is build. The `DESCRIPTION` file should be copied into the main folder of this repository. The `.Rd` files contain the function documentation and should be copied into `/man/`.
2. In the `DESCRIPTION` file, add the following tag "URL: https://www.ArchRProject.com"
